## üèÜ Results

In this work, we sought to address critical voids within the realm of ESG analysis by providing novel resources and methodologies that significantly enhance the classification and understanding of ESG data. By extending pre-trained models with our ESG-specific datasets, and training three ESG domain-specific PLMs: ESG-BERT, ESG-DistilRoBERTa, and ESG-RoBERTa, we have achieved notable improvements in model performance, setting new benchmarks for ESG classification tasks.

Our innovative pipeline for dataset annotation, leveraging both keyword searches and Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, has enabled precise and comprehensive categorization of ESG data into both four-class and nine-class schemas. This approach not only enhances the granularity of our analysis but also contributes to the broader academic and practical understanding of ESG issues. Moreover, the introduction of ESGLlama and FinLlama, domain-specific language models fine-tuned on our datasets, represents a significant leap forward in the application of LLMs to ESG-related tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in ESG classification, outperforming existing benchmarks and showcasing the efficacy of specialized fine-tuning in domain-specific contexts.
